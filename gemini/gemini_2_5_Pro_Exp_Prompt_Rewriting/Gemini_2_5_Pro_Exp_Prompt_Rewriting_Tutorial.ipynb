        "\n",
        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome! This tutorial guides you through using the Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` model) via the `genai.Client` interface to rewrite text prompts. We'll read prompts from an uploaded CSV file, use the Gemini API for rewriting, handle errors, manage rate limits (specifically the **2 RPM / 50 per day free tier limit**), and save the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Focus:** Using the `genai.Client` method, constructing requests, sending them via `client.models.generate_content`, handling specific errors with retries, and managing updated rate limits.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What this script does:**\n",
        "1.  Reads prompts from an uploaded CSV file (requires a `prompt` column).\n",
        "2.  Uses the `genai.Client` to interact with the `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` model.\n",
        "3.  Sends requests using `client.models.generate_content` with retry logic.\n",
        "4.  Prints interaction details (request attempt, response, errors) to the output.\n",
        "5.  Respects the 2 Requests Per Minute limit with appropriate delays.\n",
        "6.  Saves the original data along with rewritten prompts to an output CSV.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Google Account:** To use Google Colab.\n",
        "* **Gemini API Key:** Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).\n",
        "    * **Note:** Access to `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25` might be restricted. If API calls fail with model errors, check your access.\n",
        "* **An Input CSV File:** You need a CSV file ready to upload. This file **must contain a column named `prompt`**. It can contain other columns as well, which will be preserved in the output.\n",
        "* **Basic Python & Pandas Knowledge.**\n",
